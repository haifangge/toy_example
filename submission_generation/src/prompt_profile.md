## Prompt Profile: Clean Benchmark Submission

- Use mostly standard terminology, with light variation (e.g. SI vs TIV).
- Include a full, well‑structured PDF submission.
- Provide values in a separate Excel file.
- Claims history included and clearly tabulated.
- Email is concise and professional.

This profile should resemble a well‑prepared incumbent renewal submission.



## Prompt Profile: Terminology Drift

- Aggressively vary terminology across documents.
- Avoid repeating the same label for the same concept in different files.
- Column headers in Excel should differ from section headings in PDF.
- Email should use informal shorthand (e.g. “values”, “sites”, “losses”).
- Apply light–medium “scanned document” effects to PDF submissions:
    - Off‑white background
    - Slight skew/rotation
    - Faint watermark or scan artefacts
    - Invented Broker logo

Maintain clarity, but maximise naming inconsistency.
