## Prompt Profile: Clean Benchmark Submission

- Use mostly standard terminology, with light variation (e.g. SI vs TIV).
- Include a full, well‑structured PDF submission.
- Provide values in a separate Excel file.
- Claims history included and clearly tabulated.
- Email is concise and professional.

This profile should resemble a well‑prepared incumbent renewal submission.



## Prompt Profile: Terminology Drift

- Aggressively vary terminology across documents.
- Avoid repeating the same label for the same concept in different files.
- Column headers in Excel should differ from section headings in PDF.
- Email should use informal shorthand (e.g. “values”, “sites”, “losses”).
- Apply light–medium “scanned document” effects to PDF submissions:
    - Off‑white background
    - Slight skew/rotation
    - Faint watermark or scan artefacts
    - Invented Broker logo

Maintain clarity, but maximise naming inconsistency.



## Prompt Profile: Fragmented Submission

- Split core information across multiple files.
- PDF should reference information “attached separately”.
- Provide either:
  - Excel with claims history only, or
  - Excel with values only (not both).
- Use a Word document for a supplemental questionnaire or risk overview.

No single document should be fully self‑contained.



## Prompt Profile: Best Practice Submission

- Clear structure aligned with UK fair presentation principles.
- Consistent but not identical terminology.
- Include risk improvements, surveys, and loss commentary.
- Excel is well‑formatted with explanatory notes.

This profile represents an exemplary mid‑market submission.



## Prompt Profile: Deferred Information

- Omit full values from the PDF.
- Apply light–medium “scanned document” effects to PDF submissions:
    - Slight skew/rotation
    - Scan artefacts
    
- Email should state that:
  - Final values are subject to confirmation, or
  - Claims history is attached separately and summarised only.
- Excel may contain partial data, ranges, or notes.

This should reflect a realistic mid‑market time‑pressured submission.



# Prompt Profile: Rushed Renewal

- Email is informal and slightly compressed.
- PDF has minimal narrative and heavier bullet‑point use.
- Some sections are merged (e.g. Construction & Occupancy).
- Excel headers are abbreviated (e.g. “Bldg”, “Mach”, “Stock”).

Tone should reflect a broker close to renewal deadline.




Add the “scan” effect by applying:

speckle/noise
faint scan lines
subtle edge shading
and a slight rotation to the background texture only
